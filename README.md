This project is a news article fetching tool that retrieves articles from NewsAPI based on specific queries (e.g., "technology"). 
It cleans the data by removing duplicates and null values, then stores the processed articles in a SQLite database for efficient management and access. 

This project enhances information accessibility and provides a practical learning experience in API usage and data handling.
